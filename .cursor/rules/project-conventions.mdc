# Project Conventions

## 1. Structure-related features

When developing any feature that affects or depends on **project structure** (layers, modules, bootstrap, paths):

- **Read first**: `ai-docs/STRUCTURE.md`
- Follow the layer mapping (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation) and path patterns described there.

## 2. New API creation

When **creating a new API** (routes, handlers, prefixes):

- **Read first**: `ai-docs/API-STRUCTURE.md`
- Use the correct prefix: `/private`, `/admin`, `/public`, or `/` (authenticated).
- Follow the path pattern: `prefix/{rest}` (e.g. `/v1/notes`, `/admin/v1/users`).
